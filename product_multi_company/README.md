About
============
This module restricts warehouse/stock locations per user. So specific users can access the selected location only. How did it work? you need to go inside the particular user and select the location so that the selected location will be visible/accessible for that user.


Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
